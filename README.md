LuaJIT binding to libuvc

libuvc is a convenience library that makes streaming video from things such as webcams relatively easy in a cross platform way (where libusb exists).  This binding makes the library accessible from LuaJIT.

Initially, it supports a relatively simple interface to the library, adding very few Lua conveniences.  This may change over time.

If libuvc is not already on your Linux machine, then go to this site:
